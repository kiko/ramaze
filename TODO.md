# Todo

## Specifications

There are quite a few specifications that are still failing, examples of these
specs are the HTTP Digest, the Ramaze command, file dispatches and a few others.

## Documentation

It would be nice if Ramaze would be just as well documented as Innate.
Currently YARD indicates that about 50% is documented, let's see if we can get that to somewhere around 80% - 90%. It's also important to keep updating the online YARD docs and
merge the docs of Innate and Ramaze together to make it easier to use.

## Examples

Perhaps the examples could use a little update, some of the code is quite old (although might still work).

## Rake tasks

There are a few Rake tasks that are somewhat redundant such as rake release:github. Perhaps these should be removed.

## Website

The website could use a big overhaul. After a nice chat on IRC most of us agreed that it should
be updated to make it easier for new users (and existing ones) to find information, read
about real world examples and all that.

It's important for the new website to clearly show what makes Ramaze unique along with a few links to the YARD documentation, the Github repository and so on. The old website fails in
doing this as it's outdated, doesn't clearly indicate what Ramaze is and most important of all
it fails to catch the user's attention.

## Marketing

Team Ramaze is pretty small, I (Yorick), am fairly new so I'm not exactly sure how large it
used to be but looking at communities such as those of Rails and Sinatra we can do _much_
better. More people usually result in more patches and real-world examples which in turn
result in more (happy) users.
